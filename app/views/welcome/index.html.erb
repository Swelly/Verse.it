    <p>Versery lets you interact with strangers in ways that can be by turns funny, creative, and profound. Get any Twitter user's last 30 tweets and use their words to construct a poem (no more than 140 characters, thoughâ€”"brevity is the soul of wit," after all!). When your poem is complete, it will be shared to your Twitter with a mention to the user you sourced the words from.</p>
    <p>If you're very creative (or lucky... or bawdy...), you just might earn a special title in the Kingdom of Versery for your efforts!</p>
    <p>Ready to give it a shot? Sign in with your Twitter account and write away!</p>
